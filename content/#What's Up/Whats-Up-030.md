Every week, I try to read a few articles about tech, productivity, finances... and I summarize what I found relevant here:

* __A simple introduction to Test Driven Development with Python__: This is a really quick intro to TDD, but it is enough to understand the Red, Green, Refacto Scheme | [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-test-with-python-997ace2d8abe/)
<br></br>
* __Using Ansible to interact with web endpoints__: Let's play with the URI Ansible module | [https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/ansible-web-endpoints](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/ansible-web-endpoints)
<br></br>
* __Ten ‘antipatterns’ that are derailing technology transformations__: If McKinsey says it, it must me true ! ( And yes, I definitely agree with most of these 10 ideas. )| [https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/ten-antipatterns-that-are-derailing-technology-transformations](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/ten-antipatterns-that-are-derailing-technology-transformations)
<br></br>
* __Using Team Topologies to discover and improve reliability qualities__: Nice example on how superimposing representation of both the organisation ( using Team Topologies ) and the product ( using DDD concept ) can help to understand pain points ( what should happens vs. what really happens )| [https://www.joaorosa.io/2020/08/18/using-team-topologies-to-discover-and-improve-reliability-qualities/](https://www.joaorosa.io/2020/08/18/using-team-topologies-to-discover-and-improve-reliability-qualities/)
