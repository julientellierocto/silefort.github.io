Every week, I try to read a few articles about tech, productivity, finances... and I summarize what I found relevant here:

* __What happens when...__: What happens when you enter google.com in your browser, from the electric impulsion in your keyboard to graphical rendering in your web browser | [https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when)
<br></br>
* __Use Vim macros to automate frequent tasks__: A quick introduction to Vim Macros and how it can save you quite a fair amount of time | [https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/use-vim-macros](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/use-vim-macros)
<br></br>
* __Google Colaboratory__: I didn't know Google provided such service: it's like jupyter but linked to your drive account and without nothing to setup beforehand | [https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb)
<br></br>
* __The Rise Of Architecture__: This is quite an old talk by Gene Kim, one of the authors of the book 'Accelerate', but there is still a lot to take away about Architecture, Devops, Organisation... | [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7khGOTyU8Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7khGOTyU8Q)
