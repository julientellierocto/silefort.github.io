Every week, I try to read a few articles about tech, productivity, finances... and I summarize what I found relevant here:

* __The Social Dilemma__: I am currently exploring a lot my own relationship with technologies and how it affects me ( how it affects my mood, my capacity to focus...), this Netflix documentary is a good starting point if you want to reflect on this topic too | [https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/)
<br></br>
* __This is how I git__: The Lead Dev of curl explains how he uses git | [https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/09/this-is-how-i-git/](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/09/this-is-how-i-git/)
<br></br>
* __Gping__: Ping, but with a graph | [https://github.com/orf/gping](https://github.com/orf/gping)
<br></br>
* __Bit__: bit is an experimental modernized git CLI | [https://github.com/chriswalz/bit](https://github.com/chriswalz/bit)
<br></br>
