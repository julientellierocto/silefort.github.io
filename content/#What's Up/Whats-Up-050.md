Every week, I try to read a few articles about tech, productivity, finances... and I summarize what I found relevant here:

* __Don't Copy Paste Into A Shell__: Yes, don't do that please ! | [https://briantracy.xyz/writing/copy-paste-shell.html](https://briantracy.xyz/writing/copy-paste-shell.html)
<br></br>
* __Vim #94: Sharpening the Axe ( VimConf 2020)__: I really liked the message behind this talk: Vim is a tool, and instead of trying to copy someone else's tool, just sharp your own from scratch | [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEShYRRVZOE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEShYRRVZOE)
<br></br>
* __An In-Depth Guide to Personal Cybersecurity__: This is general cybersecurity, nothing fancy and you probably already know most of what is in the article but still, it is always a good reminder | [https://medium.com/@nickrosener/an-in-depth-guide-to-personal-cybersecurity-be98ba47c968](https://medium.com/@nickrosener/an-in-depth-guide-to-personal-cybersecurity-be98ba47c968)
<br></br>
* __Emmet__: Emmet is a text editor plugin ( and it works in Vim ) that works like a text expander for html/css balises | [https://emmet.io/](https://emmet.io/)
