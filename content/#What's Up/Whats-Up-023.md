Every week, I try to read a few articles about tech, productivity, finances... and I summarize what I found relevant here:

* __Why optimizing for MTTR over MTBF is better for business__: "When failures happen infrequently, itâ€™s hard to optimize your response process", hence, for the author of this article, it is always better to check your Mean Time To Recovery than your Mean Time Between Failure | [https://grafana.com/blog/2020/07/01/why-optimizing-for-mttr-over-mtbf-is-better-for-business/](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/07/01/why-optimizing-for-mttr-over-mtbf-is-better-for-business/)
<br></br>
* __Better Organize Your Day With This Time Management Technique__: This article talks about the ALPEN productivity technique | [https://blog.trello.com/aplen-time-management-technique?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=trello-july2020-newsletter2](https://blog.trello.com/aplen-time-management-technique?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=trello-july2020-newsletter2)
<br></br>
* __Create a Simple Trend Following System__: I just discovered this podcast and love this episode, the guest ( Nick Radge ) explains his exact process on how to build a simple trend following trading system | [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUUd2kq1Mh4&list=PLOs2nEkQ-Q5NLw04m_hVEo9Au8SLvz_67](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUUd2kq1Mh4&list=PLOs2nEkQ-Q5NLw04m_hVEo9Au8SLvz_67)
<br></br>
* __Les bases du poker__: ( In French ) I used to play poker a lot online like 10 years ago but totally gave up. After a live game with my family a few weeks ago I watched a few youtube videos and I was amazed at how the theory behind the game improved ( or how I didn't look at the right books/articles... 10 years ago ), this ebook is a really good introduction if you want to understand why Poker is not just a game of chance and how people can beat the odds on the long run. | [https://www.kill-tilt.fr/les-bases-du-poker/](https://www.kill-tilt.fr/les-bases-du-poker/)
